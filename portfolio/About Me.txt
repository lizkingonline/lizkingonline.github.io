About Me:

Hello everyone! It's me, Elizabeth King! My background is in science, biology to be specific, with a long stint in the biotechnology field. I love science as it shapes our world and helps us define it. A few years ago I transitioned my career from the biotech field into computer science as I realized there is a whole world inside our computers that we can create and help everyone access. I am having a blast learning new languages like CSS and JavaScript as well as low- or no-code platforms like Joomla! and WordPress. I am also enjoying expanding my knowledge of HTML as well as learning more about accessibility and helping everyone access the internet.
